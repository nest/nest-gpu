Welcome to NEST GPU's documentation!
====================================

`NEST GPU <https://github.com/nest/nest-gpu>`__ is a GPU-MPI library for simulation of large-scale networks of spiking
neurons. Can be used in Python, in C++ and in C.

.. note::

   NEST GPU was developed under the
   name  `NeuronGPU <https://github.com/golosio/NeuronGPU>`__  before
   it has been integrated in the NEST Initiative, see  `Golosio et
   al.Â (2021) <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.627620/full>`__.
   Currently this repository is being adapted to the NEST development
   workflow.

With this library it is possible to run relatively fast simulations of
large-scale networks of spiking neurons employing GPUs.
For instance, on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU board it is
possible to simulate the activity of 1 million multisynapse AdEx neurons
with 1000 synapse per neuron in little more than 70 seconds per second
of neural activity using the fifth-order Runge-Kutta method with adaptive
stepsize as differential equations solver.
The MPI communication is also very efficient. The Python interface is
very similar to that of the NEST simulator: the most used commands are
practically identical, dictionaries are used to define neurons,
connections and synapsis properties in the same way.

To start using it, have a look at the examples in the `python/examples <https://github.com/nest/nest-gpu/tree/main/python/examples>`_
and `c++/examples <https://github.com/nest/nest-gpu/tree/main/c%2B%2B/examples>`_ folders.
