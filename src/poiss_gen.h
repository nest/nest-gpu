Short description
+++++++++++++++++

Generate spikes with Poisson process statistics

Description
+++++++++++

The poisson_generator simulates a neuron that is firing with Poisson
statistics, i.e. exponentially distributed interspike intervals. It will
generate a `unique` spike train for each of it's targets. If you do not want
this behavior and need the same spike train for all targets, you have to use a
``parrot_neuron`` between the poisson generator and the targets.

Parameters
++++++++++

The following parameters can be set in the status dictionary.

======== ======= =======================================
 rate    Hz      Mean firing rate
 origin  ms      Reference time for start and stop
 start   ms      Activation time, relative to origin
 stop    ms      Deactivation time, relative to origin
======== ======= =======================================
