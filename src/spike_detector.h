Short description

Collecting spikes from neurons

Description
+++++++++++

The ``spike_detector`` collects and records all spikes it receives
from neurons that are connected to it.

Any neuron from which spikes have to be recorded must be connected to
the spike recorder using the standard ``Connect`` command.

.. warning::

  Differently from NEST, the connection ``weights`` and ``delays`` are
  taken into account by the spike recorder. This device will be modified
  in the future in order to have a device more similar to the one of NEST.

To record and retrieve the spikes emitted by a neuron, a new recorder has
to be created using the command ``CreateRecord``. For more details about
the continuous recording of variables see the :doc:`multimeter <multimeter>`
documentation.

Here follows an example:

::

  neuron = nestgpu.Create("aeif_cond_beta", 3)
  spike_det = nestgpu.Create("spike_detector")
  nestgpu.Connect([neuron[0]], spike_det, {"rule": "one_to_one"},
{"weight": 1.0, "delay": 1.0, "receptor":0})

  recorder = nestgpu.CreateRecord("", ["spike_height"], [spike_det[0]], [0])

  nestgpu.Simulate()

  recorded_data = nestgpu.GetRecordData(record)
  time = [row[0] for row in recorded_data]
  spike_height = [row[1] for row in recorded_data]

The output is thus a continuous variable, which is 0 when no spikes are emitted
by the neuron, and is ``weights`` when a spike is emitted.

.. note::

  A faster implementation for spike recording, which is also similar to
  the one of NEST in terms of output, is described in the guide of
  :doc:`how to record spikes <../guides/how_to_record_spikes>`.
