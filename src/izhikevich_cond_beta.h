Conductance-based Izhikevich neuron model

Description
+++++++++++

Implementation of the simple spiking neuron model introduced by Izhikevich
[1]_ with synaptic conductance modeled by a beta function, as described in [2]_.
The dynamics are given by:

.. math::

  \frac{dV_m}{dt} &= 0.04 V_m^2 + 5 V_m + 140 - u + I \\
  \frac{du}{dt} &= a (b V_m - u))


.. math::

   &\text{if}\;\;\; V_m \geq V_{th}:\\
   &\;\;\;\; V_m \text{ is set to } c\\
   &\;\;\;\; u \text{ is incremented by } d\\
   & \, \\
   &v \text{ jumps on each spike arrival by the weight of the spike}

This implementation uses the standard technique for forward Euler integration.
This model is multisynapse, so it allows an arbitrary number of synaptic
rise time and decay time constants. The number of receptor ports must be specified
at neuron creation (default value is 1) and the receptor index starts from 0
(and not from 1 as in NEST multisynapse models).
The time constants are supplied by by two arrays, ``tau_rise`` and ``tau_decay`` for
the synaptic rise time and decay time, respectively. The synaptic
reversal potentials are supplied by the array ``E_rev``. Port numbers
are automatically assigned in the range from 0 to ``n_receptors-1``.
During connection, the ports are selected with the synapse property ``receptor``.
