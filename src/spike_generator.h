Short description

Generate spikes from an array of spike-times

Description
+++++++++++

A spike generator can be used to generate spikes at specific times
which are given to the spike generator as an array.

The following parameters can be set in the status dictionary.

============== ======= =======================================
**Parameters:**
--------------------------------------------------------------
 spike_times   list    Times in which spikes are emitted
 spike_heights list    Weight of the spikes emitted
============== ======= =======================================

Spike times are given in milliseconds, and must be sorted with the
earliest spike first. All spike times must be strictly in the future
(i.e. greater than the current time step).

It is possible that spike times do not coincide with a time step,
i.e., are not a multiple of the simulation resolution.
In that case, spike times will be rounded to the nearest
simulation steps (i.e. multiples of the resolution).

Sending multiple occurrences at same time step is not possible,
however the spike height can be regulated to be the equivalent of
having multiple spikes at once.
The spikes are thus delivered with the weight indicated by
the spike height multiplied with the weight of the connection.
