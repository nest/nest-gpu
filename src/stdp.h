Short description

Synapse type for spike-timing dependent plasticity

Description
+++++++++++

The STDP class is a type of synapse model used to create
synapses that enable spike timing dependent plasticity
(as defined in [1]_).
Here the weight dependence exponent can be set separately
for potentiation and depression.


Parameters
++++++++++

========== =======  ======================================================
 tau_plus  ms       Time constant of STDP window, potentiation
 tau_minus ms       Time constant of STDP window, depression
 lambda    real     Step size
 alpha     real     Asymmetry parameter (scales depression increments as
                    alpha*lambda)
 mu_plus   real     Weight dependence exponent, potentiation
 mu_minus  real     Weight dependence exponent, depression
 Wmax      real     Maximum allowed weight
========== =======  ======================================================
